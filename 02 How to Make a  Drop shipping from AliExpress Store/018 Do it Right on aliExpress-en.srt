1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:11,400
Do it live on and express no invites no name cards from a supplier or on the products which are buying

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,060
No.

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:25,060
And missing and no incomplete parts gets feedback from your customer or all the other one or what.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:35,610
That's good for your self to know the quality before going to make your e-commerce site what you're

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:43,320
actually being done exactly to check and I get from your supply up are some more interesting.

6
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:56,820
I just find that when you buy any products from CBS or your suppliers you have to about to drop that

7
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,290
customer address for shipping.

8
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,600
But the contract you get exactly will be you for free shipping.

9
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,860
Again I commend you.

10
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:16,880
You make a lot of the offer for free shipping get to add more money to get more income.

11
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,390
What should be.

12
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,680
That's all.

13
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,780
I see you next section with Mike.
