look come on the Amazon Dot com.

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,180
Let's begin with with the site of Alecs the rest of the here.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,490
Here's the site or at Express.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,710
You see the category with them different.

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,000
That's the other CHONE here.

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,190
When you scroll down and we see for different categories.

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,410
The front price on accessories.

9
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,920
It.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,170
Claudius furnitures.

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:56,040
There are a lot of categories of work done multiple or that some of thousands of products at the store

12
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,760
of Express.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,120
Now I'm going to do search for specific products.

14
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,880
Let's go to your assertion about the product with the name of

15
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,320
charm's Rozy elements charms make.

16
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:31,980
I encourage you to make a new account with the express throw to program to get the best price from an

17
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:38,140
express because of the risk that provides the affiliate program some special prices.

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,040
So here we see the BSA results.

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,130
Let's scroll down to see more options for who shot up.

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,580
Order of about 10 be for that.

21
00:01:52,910 --> 00:02:00,100
With the prices you get some from the loaded gun.

22
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,060
OK received.

23
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,070
Clear.

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:10,700
See thoroughly it works OK with the free shipping that's good idea.

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,550
Us either of four point six seven.

26
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,950
And to see the other products with the price hope that one point to nine for our loss there will be

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,990
screws up.

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:33,680
She examined and mentions Machar's three times to see the other product smell the charms.

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,930
For the price of two point ninety nine or so I would do well to either but that's it for me for your

30
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:52,530
website or store to be with free checking on us so you will see this product with this price.

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,070
Look at it to see it.

32
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,910
The price is being a good price.

33
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,000
So when we when we will add these other products to you your to store exactly.

34
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,640
You will keep the price as something different.

35
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:16,550
So this project as example will be up three point five for that up to make some margins for profit to

36
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,270
you.

37
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,490
Let's go to Amazon to send us along with them.

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:31,780
We've been in with the same products like in any number of Rigaud animal charm's as example.

39
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:43,730
Now just a click here for enter to see the results of exactly that price on Amazon seems to be something

40
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,110
different than unexpressed.

41
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,120
I can see that these prices went down at 20.

42
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,140
These busy blogs.

43
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,340
Super charm and been done.

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,700
It's about seven point ninety five dollars.

45
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,770
OK.

46
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,700
And analysts as well are seeing lower more results.

47
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,940
Again you see the six point five nine it's a scroll down to see.

48
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,140
OK.

49
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,980
We have that the different prices that's with the same category from Express and Amazon.

50
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,070
more low than Amazon.

51
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,830
So that on this is that profit when you add your products from Adisa rest with the with the low price

52
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,230
and you.

53
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:58,390
You will keep some profits of your weight 10 percent or 5 percent or 10 percent of what you want to

54
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,180
I encourage you to make it a little bit margin for profit.

55
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,720
Exactly.

56
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,340
So that's point.

57
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:20,090
But before we are going to continue with this with this issue that we're adding get products for your

58
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,820
e-commerce site.

59
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,520
Exactly.

60
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:41,990
And to do that to do that we have to to check out the products the day bottles of this product from

61
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,290
I'm going to show you how to see that in.

62
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,980
How to see that niche.

63
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,550
How do you see that traffic Hutchie to visit.

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:03,890
How do you see the importance of products at the United States or European countries or other or different

65
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,620
countries.

66
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:12,160
By using Google Trends and the Google Adwords up that could be on the next lecture.

67
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,510
And that's one for this lecture.

68
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,830
So you get by.
