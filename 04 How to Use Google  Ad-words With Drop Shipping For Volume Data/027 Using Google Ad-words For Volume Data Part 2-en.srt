1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:12,630
That seems to be to be take a lot of time and that's going OK.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,960
That's a good guy.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm not big on the long end to this.

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:26,700
Two of more look at that come what might small sides see us as giant

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,720
as I mentioned before we don't need to go to campaign or home just.

6
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,920
We have to go to the tools.

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,890
But actually

8
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,450
OK.

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,630
And then we have to click on to that.

10
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,820
Show us how many visits how many people.

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,520
Our Lord said all about this.

12
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,990
This your on that night or any any Gorgon

13
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:19,470
and this will help us to exactly specific data up or a specific product on our site.

14
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,830
You don't need to add any products which had a lot of water.

15
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,330
Or what is the result of incest.

16
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:42,920
Engine because of where we are going to our products which had maximum interest to people over the world

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,230
or in a special place or in different places.

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:56,550
And just the moment we are loading again your current data and have gone into to see the result.
